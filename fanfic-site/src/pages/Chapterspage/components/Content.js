                          Seven teenagers adept in various types of magic were now working for Cronus. Their victory against Jay and his friends looked like a guarantee at that point.

                          Theresa could not predict their movements even with her psychic abilities. She thought they even had their own psychic. Herry's strength couldn't outmatch the brute force of the earth magic used against them by the girl in the purple hat. What did they call her? Oh, right- Pomelia. Archie and Atlanta had both been knocked out. Even Neil's luck could not help them now.

                        The Athenian pantheon of ancient times had been one of humanities most ambitious offerings to the gods when the world was young. But now it was no more than a clich√©d tourist attraction for unoriginal adventure seekers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At night though, the ruins were closed to outsiders. Tonight of all nights proved tedious to navigate through the ancient pantheon. The clouds covered the moon from an earlier rain storm. The ancient temple's stone hardly reflected enough light for any late night tourist to sneak around, despite the moisture giving the surroundings a slight shine. Fortunately, a ghostly fate did not need of such frivolities. One fate was here now, waiting by a column.

                        Now Herry found himself approaching her while she sat catching her breath under a big oak tree. She leaned against the tree, face towards the sky and eyes closed. Her breathing returned to a steady pace. Now that he got closer Herry realized she wasn't actually wearing her hat today. That was a headband. How did he mistake that? Weird. Trick of the light he guessed.

Komos collared the last of the four werewolf children to their respective "full moon rooms" deep in the building's basement.
